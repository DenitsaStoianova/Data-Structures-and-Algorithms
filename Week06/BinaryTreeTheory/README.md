# What is binary tree?

```
A binary tree is an ordered tree in which every node has at most two children.
1. Every node has at most two children.
2. Each child node is labeled as being either a left child or a right child.
3. A left child precedes a right child in the ordering of children of a node.
The subtree rooted at a left or right child of an internal node is called the nodeâ€™s left subtree or right subtree, respectively.
