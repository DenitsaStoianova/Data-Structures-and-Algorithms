# What is Hash Table? 
```
Hash table is a data structure that represents data in the form of key-value pairs. Each key is mapped to a value in the hash table. The keys are used for indexing the values/data. A similar approach is applied by an associative array.

# How do we represent data?
```
Data is represented in a key value pair. Each data is associated with a key. The key is an integer that point to the data.
Key | Data

# What is hash function?
```
Hashing is a technique to convert a range of key values into a range of indexes of an array. For example hash function converts a given big phone number to a small practical integer value. The mapped integer value is used as an index in the hash table. In simple terms, a hash function maps a big number or string to a small integer that can be used as the index in the hash table.
