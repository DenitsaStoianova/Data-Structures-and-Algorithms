# Different Types Of Binary Trees

# Full Binary Tree

***A full Binary tree is a special type of binary tree in which every parent node/internal node has either two or no children.***

```
	                   A 
                   /   \
                  B     C
                       / \ 
                      F   G 
                     / \
                    H   I
```

***Full Binary Tree Properties***

```
I -> number of internal nodes
N -> the total number of nodes
L -> number of leaves
λ -> number of levels
```
```
1. The number of leaves is I + 1.

2. The total number of nodes is 2*I + 1.

3. The number of internal nodes is (N – 1) / 2.

4. The number of leaves is (N + 1) / 2.

5. The total number of nodes is 2*L – 1.

6. The number of internal nodes is L – 1.

7. The number of leaves is at most 2*λ - 1.
